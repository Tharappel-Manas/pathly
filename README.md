AI Verse Hackathon Project

Project Overview

We’re building an AI-powered career guidance tool that actually looks at your resume and shows you which jobs fit you best. It doesn’t just match keywords—it digs into your skills and experience, then connects you to real roles and live job postings. On top of that, it explains why certain jobs make sense for you.

Work Completed So Far

Right now, the system can read resumes in both PDF and image formats. It pulls out your skills, tools, and experience, then organizes everything neatly in JSON. For matching, we’re using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to line you up with roles in our local database. We’ve also hooked up to the Adzuna API, so you get real, up-to-date job postings. The system gives you a shortlist of top jobs and roles, and you can upload your resume and get recommendations in one go—it all works end-to-end.

What’s Next

We’re aiming to make the matching smarter by using embedding-based models. You’ll get clearer explanations about any skill gaps, plus confidence scores for the matches. We also want to offer you a personalized learning roadmap, so you can see exactly what you need to do to get ready for a role. And as people use the system, their feedback will help us keep improving the recommendations.

This tool isn’t just for job seekers. Universities and training centers can use it to match their courses directly to real job roles. That way, students get job suggestions based on the classes they’ve taken and the skills they’ve learned along the way.
